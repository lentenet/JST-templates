Please fill in the metadata above carefully and accurately, up to and
including the date your review is submitted.  The review itself goes
here, after the metadata and a blank line. It may help to know that we
use the copy editing marker TK to indicate content that is "to come,"
including in the metadata. Since the letter combination TK almost never
occurs in English, changing placeholders is a simple matter of find and
replace.

JST uses Markdown---or MultiMarkdown, to be precise---to turn a single
master file into a well-built web page and a PDF. Markdown has a few
simple formatting rules, and to help us typeset your review quickly and
accurately, we ask that you write or convert your review to Markdown and
submit it to JST as a plain text file (`.txt` or `.md`). The basics are
as follows.

Put a blank line break between paragraphs. Lines set off with single
carriage returns 
like this 
will be processed into a contiguous paragraph. We may re-wrap
paragraphs to put line breaks every 72 characters to make it easy to
reference line numbers in the editorial process.

We would prefer that authors indicate hyphens with a single `-` (eg, in
a compound word), en dashes with two `--` (eg, in page or date ranges),
and em dashes with three `---` and without spaces between words on
either side (eg, for parenthetical statements). Our machinery processes
each of these appropriately, and it is easier to check that the correct
dash has been used when they are written out in this way. (Back ticks
set off anything that should be typeset literally, as code, instead of
being processed as ordinary text.) If you are in the habit of typing en
and em dashes in unicode, and you are confident that you do so
correctly, there is no need to convert back to the [ASCII
convention][dash] of double or triple hyphens.

[dash]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash

Wrap anything to be set in italics with pairs of *single asterisks*,
`*thus*`, or _single underscores_, `_so_`. Doubles indicate **bold**,
which should not be used.

Use of smart quotes is optional. Many word processors add them as you
type. If you paste quotes “like this,” you can leave them as they are.
If you compose in a plain text editor, straight quotes (`"` and `'`)
will be processed into curly quotes automatically.

For block quotes, begin an ordinary paragraph with > (a closing angle
bracket or greater-than sign). This convention may be familiar: it
hearkens back to plain text email.

> Here's a block quote. Of course, it ought to be longer than a few
words.

Use parenthetical citation for references to the book under review.
Footnotes, if necessary, can be created with a unique reference to text
set off as a paragraph. Here is a sample footnote.[^footnote1] The note
itself can be placed anywhere in the text file, although it makes sense
to place it beneath the paragraph in which the note occurs, or at the
end of the document.

[^footnote1]: A MultiMarkdown footnote work just like a reference style
link in Markdown, used for the wikipedia link above, except that the
reference marker begins with a circumflex accent (^). The reference can
by anything you like, such as an author surname, provided it is unique.

Working in Markdown should not be onerous, even if its conventions are
new to you. (Many people find that they write in it without realizing.)
By using it for JST reviews, you help us to produce a higher quality
publication while also keeping the editorial workload light. Thank you.

Precision and the ability to generate clean code in multiple formats are
some of Markdown's most obvious benefits. If you would like to learn
more, we suggest starting with the [original Markdown][daringfireball]
tool created by the blogger John Gruber, and then proceed to the
superset [MultiMarkdown][fletcherpenney], by Fletcher Penney, which is
robust enough for an academic publication like the *Journal for
Scripture & Theology*.
